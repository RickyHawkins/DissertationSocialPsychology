                            <h1>Internet Journalist?</h1>
							<p>While this dissertation was originally to set out to find out how certain methods applied to news websites, I found my self changing how I percieved the information and the sites into categories. This in fact made me want to change how I did this but with time constraints I found my self unable.</p>
							<p>Instead of looking at the methods of gaining clicks through psychological means of design, it was more based upon the content, titles and other forms of marketing, from outrage marketing to information pandering to the left, right or the down right unimaginative.</p>
							<p>While most sites do have a set simple colour scheme the reliable one's tend to be rather simple and didn't draw away from the information with fancy colours, design and graphics, but was based purely upon the headline or post made on social media.</p>
							<p>To this degree I then had to search through my own social media and find a lot of misinformation, fact checking for my self instead of the millions who digest the information and take it for truth as the news is held highly in our heads without the thought of that they could possibly be lying to us.</p>
							<p>After such experiences while making this project I found my self more obsessed with the content rather than the website, you can have the fanciest website with pretty pictures and graphs, but that isn't what makes it, outrage marketing seems to be very prominent in this society of misinformation, so are we all expected to become journalists just to find out the correct information?</p>
